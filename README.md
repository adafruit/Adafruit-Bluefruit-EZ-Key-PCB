Create your own wireless Bluetooth keyboard controller in an hour with the Bluefruit EZ-Key: it's the fastest, easiest and bestest Bluetooth controller. We spent years learning how to develop our own custom Bluetooth firmware, and coupled with our own BT module hardware, we've created the most Maker-friendly wireless you can get!

This breakout acts just like a BT keyboard, and works great with any BT-capable device: Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. Power the module with 3-16VDC, and pair it to the computer, tablet or phone just as you would any other BT device. Now you can connect buttons from the 12 input pins, when a button is pressed, it sends a keypress to the computer. We pre-program the module to send the 4 arrow keys, return, space, 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', '1' and '2' by default. Advanced users can reprogram the module's keys using an FTDI or other Serial console cable, for any HID key report they desire.
